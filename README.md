# Jungle

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 4.2 for purposes of teaching Rails by example.

# Implemented Features

## Product Page
* When a product has 0 quantity, a sold out badge is displayed on the product list page

## Admin Features
* Admin users can list and create new categories
* Admins can add new products using the new category
* User must enter HTTP auth login/password to access admin functionality

## User Authentication
* As a Visitor I can go to the registration page from any page in order to create an account
* As a Visitor I can sign up for a user account with my e-mail, password, first name and last name
* As a Visitor I can sign in using my e-mail and password
* As a User I can log out from any page
* As a User I cannot sign up with an existing e-mail address (uniqueness validation)
* Passwords are not stored as plain text in the database. Instead, has_secure_password is used in the User model, leveraging the bcrypt gem

## Order Details Page
* The order page contains items, their image, name, description, quantities and line item totals
* The final amount for the order is displayed
* The email that was used to place the order is displayed

## Cart
* When the cart is empty and the user goes to the carts#show page, instead of displaying the contents and a stripe checkout button, display a friendly message about how it is empty and link to the home page
